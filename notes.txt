* use MongoDB / Mongoose?
    1. >> actually no, this is going out of scope and is unnecessary
    for local-only use this would be fine
    as an application that needs to be deployed to replit,
    and ideally doesn't rely on a free cloud database to see in action,
    simply using local arrays makes more sense
    2. >> another complication is that the spec overloads the _id field
        >> actually this is not the case; however, point 1 still stands

* >>1<< collection - users
    the tests appear to describe exercises as objects that exist under a user
    NOT as a separate collection

* 4 api endpoints - 
    POST /api/users (new user)
    GET /api/users (return all users in array)
    POST /api/users/:_id/exercises (add exercise)
    GET /api/users/:_id/logs (returns user's log)

* 3 optional params for GET logs
    from - earliest date
    to - latest date
    limit - int of how many logs to send

* misc TODOs
    refactor - id validation for POST exercises, GET logs - refactor to reuse code
