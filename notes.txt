* use MongoDB / Mongoose?
    >> actually no, this is going out of scope and is unnecessary
    for local-only use this would be fine
    as an application that needs to be deployed to replit,
    and ideally doesn't rely on a free cloud database to see in action,
    simply using local arrays makes more sense
    >> another complication is that the spec overloads the _id field

* 2 collections - exercise, user
    log is dynamically generated on request
    iterate through all exercises, if _id matches, add to temp array
    return user info, temp array size, and temp array

* 4 api endpoints - 
    POST /api/users (new user)
    GET /api/users (return all users in array)
    POST /api/users/:_id/exercises (add exercise)
    GET /api/users/:_id/logs (returns user's log)
